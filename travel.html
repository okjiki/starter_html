            <h3>Geographical Location: Asia</h3>
            <p>
                Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO world heritage site and a popular tourist destination in northeast Vietnam. 
                The bay is famous for its crystal clear emerald colored waters dotted with limestone mountains that rise up from the water. 
                Many tourists visit and take boat tours around the islands that tend to me named after their peculiar shape. For instance, 
                tourists can take kayak expeditions around the Teapot islets, a set of islands shaped like teapots, or be rowed around Stone Dog, 
                which appears to be shaped like a dog.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ha Long Bay region is popular for scuba diving, rock climbing and hiking, particularly in mountainous Cát Bà National Park. 
                The nearest city is Hai Phong, which is approximately 75 km away. It is easier to reach Ha Long Bay by boat because the journey 
                from Hai Phong to Ha Long Bay can take nearly 2.5 hours.
            </p>

            <h3>Geographic Location: North America</h3>
            <p> Sequoia National Park is a large forest located in the Sierra Nevada
                mountain range in California. It is famous for its gigantic sequoia
                and redwood trees, as well as its underground Crystal Cave. The park
                is a well-known attraction to many tourists, receiving more than a
                million visitors annually. In addition to its collection of giant
                trees, Sequoia National Park is also home to thousands of prevalent
                flora and fauna.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most famous feature of Sequoia National Park is the
                General Sherman tree – the largest tree in the world. Measuring in at
                275 feet tall, the tree towers over the surrounding landscape and the
                people who come to view it. As of today, the General Sherman tree is
                estimated to be around 2200 years old.
