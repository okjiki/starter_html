            <img src = "images/nico.jpeg" width = 400 alt = "Brown tabby male cat sitting on a cat perch">

            <p>Nico is a 5 year old male cat who is shy around strangers but loves his family. 
                He is a lazy cat who loves louging around all day but at the sound of people, 
                he'll disappear to one of this many hiding spots. </p>
            <p>Nico loves food. Although he is skinner than his other cat siblings, 
                when food is placed out he'll eat his portion and his siblings. 
                Nico loves treats and even though he is shy, he'll come running out for treats. </p>

            <img src = "images/Jax.jpg" width = 400 alt = "A black and white kitten sitting down and wearing a yellow collar.">
            
            <p>Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, 
                Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy 
                meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!</p>
            <p>My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since 
                we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is
                 sleepy he is happy to be held. </p>

            <p>Basil, otherwise known as Slaysil, is a very energetic white, slightly crusty and trusty, dog (bichon). 
                She gets princess treatment in her household, but also out in public. As a consequence, 
                she is very clingy and loves to lick, especially in the face.</p>
            <p>She endeavors in multiple hobbies and activities, which include flying, licking, 
                standing on two legs, ringing bells, and jumping through hula hoops.</p>

            <h2>Luna</h2>

            <img src="/images/luna.PNG" alt="Mini German shepherd sunbathing" width="200">

            <p>
                Luna is a German shepherd mix and a fireball of energy. Oftentimes,
                destroying anything in her path she will take and hide all your socks,
                shoes, and clothes for her to chew on. She loves playing catch at the
                park, it always gives her the zoomies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luna is a very jealous, loving, and protective dog. She really
                embraces her inner chihuahua and will bark at any stranger, car, or
                noise at night. She makes the perfect guard dog. But she is not at all
                aggressive. Luna is all bark no bite!
            </p>

            <h2>York</h2>

            <img src = "images/york.jpg" width = 400 alt = "He is a large Black German Shepherd."/>

            <p>York loves to stay active and go on long walks by his house. He also enjoys chewing on 
                his large assortment of toys. His favorite toy is his squeaky pig. York’s favorite food is 
                sausage, but cheese is another favorite.</p>
            <p>York is a very sociable dog and is a licensed therapy dog. He frequently visits nursing homes 
                and other places in an attempt to raise peoples’ spirits. When it comes to bedtime, York prefers 
                to sleep alone in his favorite blue dog bed. He will always be the first to get up in the morning.</p>

            <h2>Bear</h2>

            <img src="/images/bear.JPG" alt="A fluffy black, white, and tan Shiba Inu with pointed ears named Bear." width="200">

            <p>
                Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. 
                He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching 
                them and lays down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He does not like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he is 
                sometimes even so lazy that he will just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home. 
            </p>

            <h2>Sofie</h2>

            <img src="images/sofie1.JPG" alt="Beagle mix wearing glasses" width="200">

            <p>
                Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix.  Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. 
                She loves to go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly. 
                Sofie loves freshly cut grass, she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends 
                because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the trail, 
                where she can be let free to run to her hearts content.
            </p>
