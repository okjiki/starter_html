        <h2>White Sauce Pasta</h2>

        <p>White sauce pasta is a creamy and savory dish that can be enjoyed for either lunch or dinner. Inspired by a fusion of Italian and French cuisine, the rough texture of rigatoni pasta allows for heavier sauces to be picked up, including the flavor profile of this delicious sauce. This union of two cultures allows for the perfect balance between each component of the recipe, creating a fulfilling entree that every individual can enjoy.</p>

        <p>This meal is a cheap and easy alternative to the classic cheap college meal: ramen noodles. It cooks up in about 10
        minutes, and offers a ton of flavor and a more filling alternative to the typical packaged food. There is also plenty of
        room for culinary freedom and expression by adding extra sauces or spices, and substituting the pork for something like
        chicken for a healthier protein option.</p>
